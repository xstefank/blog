== Saga implemetations comparison

In this previous http://jbossts.blogspot.cz/2017/06/sagas-and-how-they-differ-from-two.html[blog post]
we have investigated the genaral motions of the https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2002fa/reading/sagas.pdf[saga pattern]
and how sagas differ from traditional ACID approach.
This article will focus on the current state of applicability of
this pattern. We will introduce, describe and compare three frameworks
that presently support saga processing, namely Narayana LRA,
Axon framework and Eventuate.io.
