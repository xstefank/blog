= Health Groups - experimental MicroProfile Health extension in Quarkus

If you are reading this blog, you have probably already heard about
https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health[Eclipse MicroProfile Health]
technology. In this article, we will introduce a new experimental extension to
MicroProfile Health 2.2 called Health groups.

All of the source code that we will present in this article is available at
https://github.com/xstefank/health-groups.

== MicroProfile 2.2 health checks

As you know, to define a health check procedure in MicroProfile Health you need
something like this:

[source,java]
----
package io.xstefank;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped // 1. CDI scope
@Readiness         // 2. Qualifier (Readiness, Liveness, Health)
public class ReadinessHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {   // 3. implements HealthCheck interface
    
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up(ReadinessHealthCheck.class.getSimpleName());
    }
}

----

So just to recap, to define a health check your class:

- needs to be a CDI bean
- needs to have one of the health qualifiers (Readiness, Liveness, deprecated Health)
- must implement the HealthCheck interface

This is everything that you can use in MicroProfile 2.2. But what if you have a
use case which doesn't fall into one of Readiness or Liveness categories? The answer
is custom health groups.

== Health Groups

Quarkus 1.4.0.CR1 comes with a new addition to this API called health groups. 
A health group is a basically a custom group of health check procedures that user
defines based on individual needs. As you probably noticed, Readiness and Liveness
health checks are already represent two predefined health groups. With the health
groups features you can defined as many additional health check groups as you need.

=== Defining a Health Group

To define a health group you need only to declare at least one health check
procedure that belong to the health group:

[source,java]
----
package io.xstefank;

import io.smallrye.health.HealthGroup;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
@HealthGroup("custom-group-1")
public class CustomGroup1Check implements HealthCheck {
    
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up(CustomGroup1HC.class.getSimpleName());
    }
}
----

So the only difference now is the change of the qualifier for which we now use
`io.smallrye.health.HealthGroup`. This qualifier takes a string argument
representing the name of the health group. This is all that needs to be done
to define a new custom health group and a health check procedure that belongs to it.

=== Accessing the custom health groups

Accessing the custom health groups is done a similar manner to the original 
MicroProfile Health 2.2 health invocations. The URL to access a custom group is
`HOST:PORT/health/group/{group-name}`. This will return all health check procedures
belonging to the groups `{group-name}`. You can also find all health check
procedures that belong to any of the custom defined health group by accessing
`HOST:PORT/health/group`. Here is a summary of endpoints exposed in Quarkus
1.4.0.CR1: 

|===
| Path | Health checks

| /health
| @Readiness, @Liveness, @Health

| /health/ready
| @Readiness

| /health/live
| @Liveness

| /health/group
| all @HealthGroup(*)

| /health/groups/group-name
| @HealthGroup("group-name")
|===

=== Combining different health groups

You are allowed to use more than one qualifier on any health check procedure that
you define. For instance:

[source,java]
----
package io.xstefank;

import io.smallrye.health.HealthGroup;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;

@ApplicationScoped
@HealthGroup("custom-group-1")
@HealthGroup("custom-group-2")
@Readiness
public class CustomGroup2ReadinessCheck implements HealthCheck {
    
    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        return HealthCheckResponse.up(CustomGroup2ReadinessCheck.class.getSimpleName());
    }
}
----

This procedure will now be available in `custom-group-1`, `custom-group-2` and the
`readiness` groups.

`/health/group`

[source,json]
----
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "CustomGroup1Check",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "CustomGroup2ReadinessCheck",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "status": "UP"
}
----

`/health/group/custom-group-1`

[source,json]
----
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "CustomGroup1Check",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "CustomGroup2ReadinessCheck",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "status": "UP"
}
----

`/health/group/custom-group-2`

[source,json]
----
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "CustomGroup2ReadinessCheck",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "status": "UP"
}
----

`/health/ready`

[source,json]
----
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "CustomGroup2ReadinessCheck",
            "status": "UP"
        },
        {
            "name": "ReadinessHealthCheck",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "status": "UP"
}
----

Where this can come particularly handy is if you want to reuse predefined
readiness and liveness procedures for custom views or simplified processing. For
example, if you have several liveness procedures one of which is not essential
and takes a long time you may want to define a health group that will be excluding
the expensive liveness health check.

== Summary

We introduced the new experimental feature extending the MicroProfile Health 2.2
API called the Health Groups. This feature is available for use in the Quarkus
1.4.0.CR1 and later releases. As we want to test features that we will eventually
try to specify in MicroProfile, you can expect that if this feature will be used 
in Quarkus you will eventually see it in the MicroProfile Health specification.
So if you are interested, please feel free to try it out, test it, and report any
issues, enhacements to https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-health/issues[our 
issue tracker].
