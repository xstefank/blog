= The role of Quarkus in the modern Java ecosystem

Last year, Quarkus celebrated its 5th birthday and one additional enormous
milestone -- 1000 contributors! Actually, there is 56 more contributors by
now. So, what does this say about Quarkus's contribution to the Java
ecosystem?

Java has come a long way since it was created 30 years ago. Originally
created for long-running applications that didn't worry too much about fast
startup times or low memory utilization. But that changed when we started
moving our workloads to clouds. These exact metrics became a prominent
influence of our production costs.

Most of the Java ecosystem wasn't ready for this change which was one of the
main drivers to create Quarkus. Quarkus provides a very modern approach to
application development. This is why it's popularity skyrocketed since it
was announced. And it is still continuously growing!
