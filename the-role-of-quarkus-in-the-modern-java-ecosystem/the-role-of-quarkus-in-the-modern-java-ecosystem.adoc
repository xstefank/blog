= The role of Quarkus in the modern Java ecosystem

Last year, Quarkus celebrated its 5th birthday and one additional enormous
milestone -- 1000 contributors! Actually, there is 56 more contributors by
now. So, what does this say about Quarkus's contribution to the Java
ecosystem?

Java has come a long way since it was created 30 years ago. Originally
designed for long-running applications that didn't worry too much about fast
startup times or low memory utilization. But that changed when we started
moving our workloads to clouds. These exact metrics became a prominent
influence of our production costs.

Most of the Java ecosystem wasn't ready for this change which was one of the
main drivers to create Quarkus. Quarkus provides a very modern approach to
application development while it is still built on the shoulders of giants --
popular and years production-tested technologies like Hibernate, Netty, or
Vert.x. This is why it's popularity skyrocketed since it was announced. And
it is still continuously growing!

So what makes Quarkus so popular? In my opinion, it's always first and
foremost about the technology itself. While performance characteristics are
surely important, they are mostly relevant in production environments where
we need to restrict utilized resources. However, developers want a
technology that helps them with the application development. Technology that
understands their needs and provides simple way to solve their problems. And
Quarkus invests heavily into the developer experience (which pays back).

The single most important productivity tool in Quarkus is its Dev mode. Dev
mode is a continuous run of your Quarkus application in which Quarkus
embraced the concept of REPL (read-eval-print loop). By simply changing our
source code, Quarkus automatically recompiles and reruns our application,
showing the result of our work in mere milliseconds. But it doesn't stop
there, Quarkus's Dev mode encompasses many other functionalities that we
utilize in our everyday tasks.
