= The role of Quarkus in the modern Java ecosystem

From its inception in 2019, Quarkus gradually grows both in terms of its
user adoption and innovation. The number of its different research and
development areas is just enormous. It's one of the most active Java
projects you can find right now.

Last year, Quarkus celebrated its 5th birthday and one additional enormous
milestone -- 1000 contributors! Actually, there is already 59 more
contributors by now. And these are contributors of the main repository only,
not taking into account additional 170 repositories under the Quarkiverse
organization (which we tackle later in this article).

Quarkus pushes boundaries everywhere you can imagine. So, what does this say
about Quarkus's contribution to the Java ecosystem?

== Quarkus to the moon and beyond

Who could have imagined 6 years ago when a few very clever minds at Red Hat
came together and decided to design a new Java framework that it could
revolutionize the ways of Java development, that it would take off so fast.
Quarkus brought a new way of thinking to the engineering workflows -- a
framework that not only cares about the performance, but also puts excessive
emphasis on the developer experience.

In my experience, there is no issue proving that Quarkus has something to
offer to any kind of audience. High throughput, lower cloud costs, and
sustainability are easy to justify, especially when we have so many real
users and their applications that validate what Quarkus offers
(https://quarkus.io/userstories/).

However, I'm also an engineer. I love to code and I understand the pains of
the everyday development tasks. Which is why I was just blown away the first
time I opened Quarkus's Dev mode. Before that, I was used to either
application server workflow or rebuild of fat JAR after each change. The dev
mode was so amazing that all applications from there (even the tooling for
the application server) was powered by Quarkus from then on.

But there was one more thing that astonished me: how fast everything moved.
The level of activity in the Quarkus's GitHub repository was unknown to me
before. Pull requests were reviewed and merged so quickly that your PR would
be out of sync in hours (even minutes from time to time). Each issue was
automatically tagged for the right people to look. More importantly, the
rate of releases was just amazing. New release every two weeks and new
feature release every month. Quarkus is keeping this pace to this day
demonstrating the commitment to both the innovation and the community.

For the purposes of this article, we can split the main Quarkus features
that have an influence on its position in the Java ecosystem into three
categories:

- Performance characteristics and optimizations
- Dev mode and everything it encloses
- Community engagement and support

Feel free to jump to relevant parts if you are already familiar with
Quarkus's basics. But we need to start from the beginning to provide the
full picture of where Quarkus stands today.

== What is Quarkus?

If this is the first time you read about Quarkus, I want to start with a
brief overview of this framework is and what it aims to achieve. Java has
come a long way since it was created 30 years ago. Originally designed for
long-running applications that didn't worry too much about fast startup
times or low memory utilization. But that changed when we started moving our
workloads to clouds. These exact metrics became a prominent influence of our
production costs.

Most of the Java ecosystem wasn't ready for this change which was one of the
main drivers to create Quarkus. Quarkus provides a very modern approach to
application development while it is still built on the shoulders of giants --
popular and production years-tested technologies like Hibernate, Netty, or
Vert.x. This is why it's popularity skyrocketed since it was announced. And
it is still continuously growing.

Quarkus is an JVM framework for enterprise application development. It
provides a platform for building microservices, serverless, or traditional
monolithic applications. Additionally, you can also use Quarkus to build
command line (CLI) applications, edge, GitHub bots, GitHub actions, or
Kubernetes operators. And this is surely not exhaustive list.

=== Technology packed runtime

Quarkus's website defines Quarkus as "a Kubernetes Native Java stack
tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed
Java libraries and standards" (https://quarkus.io/, 2025). If we break it down:

_Kubernetes native_ means Quarkus makes sure that user experience in
Kubernetes is straightforward. It provides many different pieces of
functionalities that help with the Kubernetes deployments and management. In
some cases, you don't even have to write any YAML because Quarkus can
generate all descriptors for you.

By _tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM_, the definition means that
Quarkus aims to provide a suitable platform for both the traditional JVM
deployments (runnable JAR) and GraalVM (https://www.graalvm.org/) native
binaries. The native compilation with GraalVM takes the performance
mechanisms that Quarkus provides to another level. Natively built binaries
start in mere milliseconds and rely on a very low memory. Quarkus guarantees
that as long as you use the integrations provided by quarkus (called
extensions) you can free choose between the two. Compilation to native
binary with GraalVM is triggered by a simple flag switch. Quarkus integrates
all relevant configuration for the GraalVM so your application compiles
successfully.

_Crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards_ only says that
the technology stack behind Quarkus is not fully created from scratch. Many
of the included technologies have been around for some time (e.g., Vert.x,
Jackson, Hibernate). What Quarkus provides is a unique way of their
integrations that we look into next. But in the end, you use the same
Hibernate as in any other framework so the learning curves are quite short.

=== Build time/runtime split

Quarkus is a very performant framework because it splits all application
processing into two phases - build time and runtime. Every framework needs
to execute various tasks when your application start: loading and parsing of
the configuration, classpath scanning (annotations), analyzing dependencies,
creating application model. Traditional frameworks need to execute all these
operations when the application starts. Every time it starts. So with every
restart all of this processing needs to be repeated, even if the application
didn't change.

Quarkus moves as much of the framework processing to the build time -- to
when you compile and package your application. In this way, the results of
this processing are recorded and reused when the application starts. In
other words, they are computed during build time only once and reused in
runtime.

image:images/build-time-principle-light.png[]

=== Extensions -- integrating with Quarkus

All the processing described above is further exposed for integrations that
are called extensions. Each extension integrates some library or
functionality so the extension developer can choose which parts of the
library processing can be executed during build time or what needs to be
done at runtime. For instance, imagine the path on which your OpenAPI
document is exposed. It isn't change that often so it's sufficient to only
record it once during build time. On the other hand, something like the port
on which our application runs would be unreasonable to fix at build time
since our application might run on different ports in different environments
so it is overridable at runtime.

Additionally, extensions can also provide any configuration for the seamless
GraalVM native builds. The extensions developers know the library that is
being integrated which means that they understand what kind of code the user
of their library needs to write. Providing any of the usually required
configuration for GraalVM build (e.g., reflectively accessed classes) is
thus done in the extension itself, so the users don't need to provide it
manually.

There are currently more than 750 extensions available at
https://quarkus.io/extensions/.

=== Quarkiverse

Many library developers see the value that Quarkus can bring to their users
and want to provide an extension for them. Because the number of extensions
grew so quick that the Quarkus's main repository
(https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus) started to get too big to work with,
we created the Quarkiverse (Quarkus + Universe). Quarkiverse is a GitHub
organization that encapsulates community Quarkus extensions that we couldn't
fit into the main repository. Individual repositories are maintained by the
community contributors but are fully integrated into the Quarkus ecosystem.
The repository maintainers can release their extensions as they need, and
Quarkus users can pick them for their application in the exactly same way as
with the core extension. This also means that if you want to have your own
Quarkus extension, all you need to do is to ping the Quarkus team (GitHub or
Zulip) and we can create a new repository for your extension.

The features described in this section are not all Quarkus and its
extensions can do. One of the best features that Quarkus provides are
encapsulated in its development experience called the Dev mode. Each
extension can provide its own "magic" that makes the work with the
integrated library easier or just plainly more fun. Let's look into what we
can do in the Quarkus's Dev mode next.

== Developer-focused framework

In my opinion, whether any tech is liked or not is always first and foremost
about the technology. Ask yourself what is more important to you when you
are choosing your framework? Is it performance? Or the tooling support?
Quarkus's bet is that it is the overall development experience. And if you
think about it, so many frameworks and even some programming languages have
been created solely to improve the development experience.

=== Dev mode

While performance characteristics are surely important, they are mostly
relevant in production environments where we need to restrict utilized
resources. However, developers want a technology that helps them with the
application development. Technology that understands their needs and
provides simple way to solve their problems. And Quarkus invests heavily
into the developer experience (which pays back).

The single most important productivity tool in Quarkus is its Dev mode. Dev
mode is a continuous run of your Quarkus application in which Quarkus
embraced the concept of REPL (read-eval-print loop). By simply changing our
source code, Quarkus automatically recompiles and reruns our application,
showing the result of our work in mere milliseconds. But it doesn't stop
there.

The Dev mode can start with for instance Quarkus CLI
(https://quarkus.io/guides/cli-tooling) like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ quarkus dev
...

--
Tests paused
Press [e] to edit command line args (currently ''), [r] to resume testing, [o] Toggle test output, [:] for the terminal, [h] for more options>
----

Notice that it automatically opens a debug port for you to connect if you
need. But you will find that using the Dev mode's feature can substitute
using the debugger most of the time. This command starts an interactive
terminal which commands are listed at the bottom of the screen. Try pressing
`h` while the Dev mode's terminal is in focus:

[source,bash]
----
The following commands are available:

== Continuous Testing

[r] - Resume testing
[o] - Toggle test output (disabled)

== Exceptions

[x] - Open last exception (or project) in IDE (none)

== HTTP

[w] - Open the application in a browser
[d] - Open the Dev UI in a browser

== System

[s] - Force restart
[e] - Edits the command line parameters and restarts ()
[i] - Toggle instrumentation based reload (disabled)
[l] - Toggle live reload (enabled)
[j] - Toggle log levels (INFO)
[h] - Show this help
[:] - Enter terminal mode
[q] - Quit the application
----

As you can see, there is a lot of provided functionality out of the box. For
instance, the instrumentation based reload (`i`) changes the quarkus reload
in way that if you only change the bodies of methods, Quarkus only
dynamically replaces the bytecode in your running JVM without the need to
restart the application:

[source,bash]
----
2025-02-28 14:40:43,865 INFO  [io.qua.dep.dev.RuntimeUpdatesProcessor] (vert.x-worker-thread-1) Application restart not required, replacing classes via instrumentation
2025-02-28 14:40:43,879 INFO  [io.qua.dep.dev.RuntimeUpdatesProcessor] (vert.x-worker-thread-1) Live reload performed via instrumentation, no restart needed, total time: 0.046s
----

Of course, if you do something that cannot be handled by the bytecode
replacement, the restart still takes place. Take some time to experiment
with these options, it will surely pay out.

Quarkus's Dev mode encompasses many other functionalities that we utilize in
our everyday tasks. These features include continuous testing, Dev UI, or
Dev Services make development such an enthusiastic experience, that it's not
surprising people like to use Quarkus. Let's now go over these feature and
explain what they are about.

=== Continuous testing

If you press `r` in your Dev mode terminal, Quarkus starts the continuous
testing which is basically run of your unit tests automatically, in the
background, when the Dev mode reloads with your changes. At the bottom of the screen, you can see:

[source,bash]
----
--
All 1 test is passing (0 skipped), 1 test was run in 261ms. Tests completed at 14:46:02 due to changes to GreetingResource.class.
----

And if you change your application (so it will break the test):

[source,bash]
----
2025-02-28 14:50:09,554 ERROR [io.qua.test] (Test runner thread) Test GreetingResourceTest#testHelloEndpoint() failed
: java.lang.AssertionError: 1 expectation failed.
Response body doesn't match expectation.
Expected: is "Hello from Quarkus REST"
  Actual: Hello from Quarkus article

...

1 test failed (0 passing, 0 skipped), 1 test was run in 234ms. Tests completed at 14:50:09 due to changes to GreetingResource.class.
----

Notice that the Dev mode detects the save of the file in this case and the
test is automatically rerun in the background. This is an extremely powerful
tool since you can see the effects of your changes directly while you're
typing them. I usually have my IDE on one screen and the Dev mode running on
the next to it. I type my changes in the IDE and only pay attention to the
green color changes to red in the Dev mode terminal from time to time to
notify me that my changes are breaking some tests. This is also a great tool
to "force" you to do more TDD :).

If you think that Quarkus always reruns your full testsuite, you don't need
to worry about it. Quarkus tries to deduct which classes are you changing
and only runs the tests which are relevant to your changes.

=== Dev UI

Dev UI aims to provide a graphical interface to your Dev mode. Generally, it
has the same features as the terminal. However, some people prefer to click
and some prefer to type so the individual choice is yours.

You can open Dev UI on the http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui (or different port
if you change it) or by pressing `d` in the Dev mode terminal:

image::images/devui.png[]

The Dev UI landing page called "Extensions" provides an overview of the
extensions installed in the current application. Each extension gets a card
that it can enhance with various functionality (e.g., list CDI beans, view
OpenAPI document, or GraphiQL). Each extension can freely include whatever
it needs.

Second tab takes you to "Configuration" that lists all available
configuration options in the current application. It changes if you add or
remove extensions. The lock symbol at the beginning of the line means that
the configuration property is fixed at build time (this doesn't matter in
Dev mode, but it will when you would compile the application).

We can't go over everything here, but you can also find tabs for the
continuous testing or Dev Services that we cover next. Again, take some time
to look around.

One more very interesting thing is the "Dependencies" tab that provides an
interactive view of our application dependencies:

image:images/devui-dependencies.png[]

With the filtering mechanism at the top of the page it can be really easy to
find where a particular dependency comes from, and it's way more
entertaining that manual parsing of the dependency tree!

=== Dev Services

Dev Services represent an abstraction of remote dependent services whether
it is a database (Postgres, MongoDB), messaging provider (Kafka, RabbitMQ),
or security (Keycloak). The Dev services are automatically started by the
Quarkus's Dev and test modes. So, you don't have to mix the provider
instances for development and test which is extremely useful in the
combination with continuous testing. It essentially boils down to starting a
particular OCI (Docker or Podman) container for the particular provider
(utilizing Testcontainers), but it doesn't have to. Some Dev services (e.g.,
Derby or H2) start in-process. You can find the list of all extensions that
support Dev services at https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-services.

You can disable most of the Dev services with configuration. Either with the
explicit disabling property (e.g., `quarkus.keycloak.devservices.enabled`)
or with an implicit definition of the uniquely-defining instance of the
provider. For instance, if you define the connection URL to a database
(`quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url`), Quarkus will use your configured database
and won't start a new container.

If your Dev mode starts a Dev Services that can be utilized by multiple
Quarkus instances (e.g., Keycloak, Kafka, RabbitMQ), the Dev Services is by
default shared among all application that need it. Of course, that also
means that you need to track which Dev mode "owns" particular Dev Service
because if you close it, all other Dev modes will most likely break :). But
that's a small price to pay. Quarkus understands that you want to use a
technology (because you added an extension for it) so it will make sure that
your experience is as seamless as possible. You don't need to figure out how
to run everything on your machine. If you simply have Docker (or Podman)
installed, Quarkus takes care of everything for you.

=== The power of Quarkus's Dev mode

To give you an idea of typical development workflow, I want to describe the
car rental application we develop in our latest Quarkus book called "Quarkus
in Action" which was released in January 2025 (there is a link to a free
e-book at the end of the article). The car rental application consists of
five Quarkus services that communicate together via various protocols and
messaging technologies including Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, GraphQL, gRPC, and
REST:

image::images/car-rental.png[]

In the architecture diagram, the Quarkus services represent user developed
services and are marked with the Quarkus logo. The Inventory CLI is an
example command line application that manages the cars fleet. You can find
the code at https://github.com/xstefank/quarkus-in-action. If we start the
remaining business services in Dev mode (they all run on different ports),
all remaining services start automatically as Dev Services (disclaimer, in
the book we use older Quarkus version that doesn't have the LGTM Dev service
- https://quarkus.io/guides/observability-devservices-lgtm). Together 10
containers that start automatically, just because we run all Quarkus
applications in Dev modes. We as users don't need to supply any
configuration for these services manually, but of course it's possible to
override the default if there is a need.

== Community engagement

Quarkus quickly became one of the most popular JVM projects on GitHub. With
its now over 1000 contributors, it has already more than 50 000 commits. And
we are only talking about the main `quarkusio/quarkus` repository, not
including any of the 170 Quarkiverse repositories which would add even more
activity. As you can see in the following image, the commits frequency is
steady throughout the years:

image:images/quarkus-code.png[]

And similarly, the release frequency follows the same line. Quarkus releases
a new feature (minor) release every month with a few bug fix (micro)
releases in between.

[source,bash]
----
$ git for-each-ref --sort=-creatordate \
  --format '%(refname) %(creatordate)' --count=10 refs/tags

refs/tags/3.18.0 Wed Jan 22 16:15:06 2025 +0000
----

With such a frequent release cycle, you might think it could be hard to keep
up with upgrades, this is why Quarkus provides two ways in which you can
consume releases: latest/greatest and Long Term Support (LTS) releases. both
have their relevant user bases depending on preference and project use
cases.

Users can easily upgrade their Quarkus applications with the build-in
mechanism called Quarkus update. You can simply run one of the following
commands to update your Quarkus project to the latest available version:

[source,bash]
----
# CLI
quarkus update
----

If you want to stick to a paritcular stream (e.g., LTS), you can add the
`-Dstream` flag:

[source,bash]
----
# CLI
quarkus update -Dstream=3.15
----

For instance, if your Quarkus project is on 3.15.1, `quarkus update` will
bump it to 3.19.1 (latest release as of the time of this writing), and
`quarkus update -Dstream=3.15` will bump it to `3.15.3.1` (latest 3.15.x LTS
release).

=== Quarkus LTS

Since not all users want to move as fast as Quarkus offers, Quarkus
introduced the concept of long term releases (LTS) which are streams that
Quarkus community keeps supported for longer periods (usually one year). You
can check which releases are LTS together with the proposed release dates at
here https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Release-Planning.

Quarkus LTS is also supported as an enterprise subscribtion from Red Hat in
a Red Hat build of Quarkus product.




=== Contributing to Quarkus

The real value of this community is in its approach to
contributions. With such a frequency of changes, it's very valuable that
every PR gets reviewed within ours. You don't need to wait for days to get
things done. And if you have any issues, you just need to ask. Quarkus
engineers are very willing to help you, no matter the problem you are
facing.

Each contribution matters. It's not only about the code. For instance, if
you want to write just the tests or the documentation (it's called guides in
Quarkus) to ease yourself to contributing to Quarkus, that awesome!!! It's
also fantastic way to get to know the framework internals in the
fastest possible way.
